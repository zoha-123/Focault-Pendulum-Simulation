# Focault-Pendulum-Simulation
A physics-based simulation of the **Foucault pendulum**, demonstrating how Earth’s rotation causes the apparent precession of a pendulum’s oscillation plane. Includes latitude-dependent behavior (poles, mid-latitudes, equator) with **time scaling** to make the otherwise slow precession observable.
